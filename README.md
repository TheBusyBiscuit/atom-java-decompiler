## Java Decompiler (for Atom)

This package allows you to view Java .class files via the [Procyon Decompiler](https://bitbucket.org/mstrobel/procyon)

When opening a .class file, this package creates a temporary decompiled .java file that is opened instead of the compiled and unreadable .class file.
Changing any code in the decompiled version will NOT have any effect on the compiled .class file.

Note that this also works for opening .class files that are inside a compiled .jar archive.
